**Kenyan Number Plates**
------------------------


----------


**Introduction**
numberplatesdiffrence.py is a python code that calculates the number of vehicles bought between any two Kenyan civilian Number Plates, with the two number plates excluded.

**Features**

 - It accepts number plates in the format KZZ 999Z  and KZZ 999 (with or
   without the last letter).
 
 - It accepts both lower case and upper case letters or a mixture of the
   two.
   
 - Accepts values between KAA 001 to KZZ 999 then it starts at KAA 001A and ends KZZ 999Z.
 - Letters "I" and "O" are omitted and the KAF series between KAA 001A to KZZ 999Z is reserved for the Kenya Air Force, hence it is omitted.

**NB**: *There is not restriction to use of any valid number plates within the range (KAA 001 to KZZ 999Z) that have not yet been officially issued.*
